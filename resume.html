        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p class="spacing">
                After getting my degree in Computer Science, I would like to pursue
                an internship with a firm where I may work and progress through the ranks,
                in order to secure a career where I may work to ensure cyber-safety.
            </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
            <p class="spacing">
                Palm Desert High School in Palm Desert, California. I attended from 2016-2020.
                I was enrolled in all Honors classes my first couple of years until I entered the
                Advanced Placement portion of High School where I was enrolled in AP Lang. I am
                interested in attending San Marcos in San Diego where I want to pursue a degree in
                Computer Science.
            </p>

        <h2>Volunteer Experience</h2>
            <p class="spacing">
                I helped organize a blood drive, as well as run stands and organization for the 5k.
                I participated a lot while I spent time in the Health Academy. I realized that the medical
                field was not for me, and decided to take on a career that fit closer to my interests. Even though
                I did not spend much time participating in events, I learned what my real passion was in life through
                my experiences.
            </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p class="spacing">
                My skills include strong communication skills, computer experience, problem solving readiness, motivational mindset, and the capability to
                adapt and learn. I consider myself to be a motivated and learned individual who can achieve greatness with
                the correct mindset and willingness to overcome difficulties.
            </p>
