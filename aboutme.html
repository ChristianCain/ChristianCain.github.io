        <h2>About Me</h2>

                        <p class="spacing">
                            Hello, my name is Christian Cain, and I am currently a senior at Palm Desert High School.
                            As a senior, the time is approaching for college applications and career goal decisions in order to secure a hopeful
                            future for myself. Computer Science so far has been an exciting learning experience for me as it is opening doors to
                            new career ideas that before did not seem possible. Coding is something that peeks my interest,
                            because it is the language behind all of our electronic lives. Whether that be video games, applications,
                            websites, etc.  As an individual, I consider myself to be an avid explorer and challengeseeker.
                            </p>

                        <p class="spacing">
                            Everything we use runs a set of code created by an individual; whether that be our movies and shows, video games, mobile phones,
                            computers, and etc. They all run a specific language in order to carry out the desired function. Personally, being around a Playstation
                            and Microsoft PC all my life have really intrigued the idea, "How are my favorite games made?" Simple. Coding. Finding out I could
                            learn how just about every software is made has peaked the notion to me that I can find a career creating and doing what I love.
                            Taking away the simplest idea that it is possible to achieve something with time and effort has saved me from challenging situations.
                            </p>

                        <p class="spacing">
                            Throughout High Schoool I had never really been the social butterfly, and so participating in events was a big deal for me. I never
                            really participated in anything "impressive", but I did participate in community service my second year of High School. I helped
                            organize a blood drive and 5k. I learned how to perform CPR and earned my badge of certification the same year. Aside from community service,
                            I never participated in school related events, because I was too shy to participate in the endeavors. Instead of participating in school events,
                            I was practicing on my guitar. I spent my time after school learning the electric guitar and bass. I still play and have gotten significantly better
                            from memorizing chords, strings, frets, and notes. From all of this, I have learned that I am willing to compete and participate in anything I set
                            my mind to. It sounds like an over-used cliche, but I learned that I am motivated over my internal conflicts. I learned that asking for help is a
                            normal thing even among the masters of professions. I am a motivated individual who can achieve goals with even the most simplistic idealogies.
                            </p>
