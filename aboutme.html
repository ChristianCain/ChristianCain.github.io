        <h1>About Me</h1>


                        <p class="spacing">
                            Hello, my name is Christian Cain, and I am currently a senior at Palm Desert High School.
                            As a senior, the time is approaching for college applications and career goal decisions in order to secure a hopeful
                            future for myself. Computer Science so far has been an exciting learning experience for me as it is opening doors to
                            new career ideas that before did not seem possible. Coding is something that peeks my interest,
                            because it is the language behind all of our electronic lives. Whether that be video games, applications,
                            websites, etc.  As an individual, I consider myself to be an avid explorer and challengeseeker. I play electric
                            bass and guitar as a hobby with my friends, so I always enjoy taking on a challenge.
                            </p>

                        <p class="spacing">
                            Everything we use runs a set of code created by an individual; whether that be our movies and shows, video games, mobile phones,
                            and computers, etc, they all run a specific language in order to carry out the desired function. Personally, being around a Playstation
                            and Microsoft PC all my life have really intrigued the idea, "How are my favorite games made?" Simple. Coding. Finding out I could
                            learn how just about every software is made has peaked the notion to me that I can find a career creating and doing what I love.
                            Taking away the simplest idea that it is possible to achieve something with time and effort has saved me from challenging situations.
