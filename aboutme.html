        <h1>About Me</h1>


        <li class="fontnone">Hello, my name is Christian Cain, and I am currently a senior at Palm Desert High School.
                            As a senior, time is approaching for me to apply to colleges in order to secure a hopeful
                            future for myself. Computer Science so far has been an exciting learning experience for me as it is opening doors to
                            a new career pathway that before did not seem possible. Coding is something that peeks my interest,
                            because it is the language behind all of our electronic lives. Whether that be video games, applications,
                            websites, etc. Everything we use runs a set of code created by an individual, in which is inspiring me to
                            learn this set of skills as I have been around computers all my life. As an individual, I consider myself to
                            be an avid explorer and challengeseeker. I play electric bass and guitar as a hobby with my friends, so I always
                            enjoy taking on a challenge.
